Stellar Electric Capital Crawler
================================

This crawler script, designed for the Electric Capital Crypto Ecosystems
repository, assists in the process of updating the list of Stellar-related
projects on GitHub. It identifies new projects using specific Stellar
dependencies, compares them with the existing list in `stellar.toml`, and
updates the local copy of `stellar.toml` with newly discovered projects.
